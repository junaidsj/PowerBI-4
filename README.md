# 📊 Excel Data Cleaning and Transformation - Power BI Course Task

## 🗂️ Overview

As part of my Power BI course, I completed a hands-on task focused on Excel data transformation and cleaning. This involved using various Excel functions to standardize and format the dataset for further use in Power BI dashboards and analysis.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

I practiced and understood the following Excel functions:

- **`UPPER()`**  
  Converts all text in a cell to uppercase.  
  Example: `=UPPER(L2)` → `USA`

- **`LOWER()`**  
  Converts all text in a cell to lowercase.  
  Example: `=LOWER(K2)` → `usa`

- **`PROPER()`**  
  Capitalizes the first letter of each word.  
  Example: `=PROPER(E2)` → `Alhambra`

- **`TRIM()`**  
  Removes all extra spaces from text, leaving only single spaces between words.  
  Example: `=TRIM(C2)`

- **`CONCAT()` / `CONCATENATE()`**  
  Joins multiple text strings into one.  
  Example: `=CONCAT(A2, " - ", B2)`
